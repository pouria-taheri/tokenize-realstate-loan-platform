Tokenized Real Estate Loan Platform 🏠💸
Overview
The Tokenized Real Estate Loan Platform is a decentralized application (DApp) on Ethereum that transforms real estate investment and lending. It enables users to:

Tokenize real estate assets as ERC-721 (NFTs) or ERC-20 (fractional shares).
Borrow or lend funds using tokenized assets as collateral.
Participate in a transparent, secure, and DeFi-integrated ecosystem.

This platform enhances liquidity, democratizes access to real estate markets, and leverages blockchain for trustless transactions. Built with Solidity and the Foundry framework, it’s designed for developers and investors alike.
Features 🌟

Asset Tokenization: Create digital tokens for whole or fractional real estate ownership.
Collateralized Loans: Use tokens as collateral to borrow funds or lend to earn interest.
Smart Contracts: Secure, audited Solidity contracts for minting, lending, and repayment.
DeFi Integration: Connect with protocols like Aave or Uniswap for advanced financial operations.
Governance: (Optional) Token-based voting for platform upgrades.
User Dashboard: (If implemented) A web interface for managing tokens and loans.

Technologies 🛠️

Solidity: Smart contracts (^0.8.0).
Foundry: Framework for development, testing, and deployment (forge, cast, anvil).
Ethereum: Blockchain network (Sepolia testnet, mainnet).
OpenZeppelin: Secure contract libraries (ERC-721, ERC-20).
MetaMask: Wallet for DApp interactions.

Getting Started 🚀
Prerequisites

Rust: Foundry requires Rust. Install via:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh


Foundry: Install Foundry:
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup


MetaMask: Install the browser extension.

Ethereum Account: With testnet ETH (e.g., from a Sepolia faucet).

Alchemy/Infura: API key for Ethereum network access.


Verify Foundry:
forge --version && cast --version && anvil --version

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/pouria-taheri/tokenize-realstate-loan-platform.git
cd tokenize-realstate-loan-platform


Install Dependencies:
forge install

This fetches libraries (e.g., OpenZeppelin) listed in foundry.toml.

Set Up Environment:

Create a .env file:
ETH_RPC_URL=https://<network>.infura.io/v3/your_infura_project_id
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key


Load variables:
source .env




Compile Contracts:
forge build

Outputs artifacts to out/.


Usage 📖
Run Tests
Verify contract functionality:
forge test


Tests in test/ cover tokenization and lending logic.
For detailed output: forge test -vvv.

Start a Local Node
Run a local Ethereum node with Anvil:
anvil


Deploy to http://localhost:8545 for testing.

Deploy Contracts
Deploy to a testnet (e.g., Sepolia):
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:DeployScript --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast


Check script/Deploy.s.sol for deployment logic.
Deployed addresses are logged to the console.

Verify Contracts
Verify on Etherscan:
forge verify-contract --chain-id 11155111 --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY <contract_address> src/PropertyToken.sol:PropertyToken

Replace <contract_address> with the deployed address.
Interact with the DApp

Command Line:
cast call <contract_address> "functionName()" --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL

Example: Query token ownership or loan status.

Frontend (if available): Follow frontend/ setup (e.g., npm install && npm run start).

Workflow:

Mint a property token (e.g., ERC-721).
Use it as collateral for a loan.
Borrow/lend funds.
Repay or claim collateral.

Troubleshooting ⚠️

Build Errors: Check Solidity version in foundry.toml and run forge install.
Test Failures: Inspect logs (forge test -vvv) and update tests in test/.
Deployment Issues: Ensure $ETH_RPC_URL, $PRIVATE_KEY, and sufficient ETH.
Anvil Crashes: Restart with anvil.
